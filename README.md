# Better input for C

Gives a better input for C. Enables moving in the buffer with arrow keys, and lets you go to the start of the line with ctrl+a.

## Use
### Test
To just test the function run ```make``` and ```./main```. This will just give you an example input and just print back what you enter.

### Use in own project
To use it in own projects, just copy the ```better_input.c``` into your source folder, or wherever you have your source files, and the ```better_input.h``` file into your include folder, or wherever you have your header files.
